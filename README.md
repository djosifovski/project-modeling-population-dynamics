# Modeling Population Dynamics

## Overview
This project explores various mathematical models used to understand population dynamics in different ecological and epidemiological contexts. The aim is to analyze and simulate these models to gain insights into real-world phenomena such as the spread of diseases, competition between species, and predator-prey interactions.

## Models
- *Logistic Equation - SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in the People's Republic of China*: In this section, we use the logistic equation to model the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in China. The logistic model helps in understanding how the virus spreads over time and how interventions impact the infection rate.
- *Intraspecific Competition of _P. aurelia_ and _P. caudatum_*: This subsection focuses on the competition within species, specifically between different strains of _Paramecium_. We analyze how populations of _P. aurelia_ and _P. caudatum_ grow when isolated.
- *Interspecific Competition of _P. aurelia_ and _P. caudatum_*: Here, we study the competition between _P. aurelia_ and _P. caudatum_ when they are grown together. This helps in understanding the dynamics of coexistence and competitive exclusion.
- *Predator-Prey Model - Hudson Bay Company*: This section involves the analysis of historical data from the Hudson Bay Company, which tracked populations of lynx and hare. The data provides insights into the cyclical nature of predator-prey relationships. We simulate the predator-prey interactions using the Lotka-Volterra equations to model the oscillatory dynamics observed in the lynx and hare populations.

## Objectives
- Apply mathematical models to real-world data to understand their implications.
- Simulate population dynamics to analyze results and uncover patterns.
- Draw meaningful conclusions from the models to suggest interventions or explanations for observed phenomena.
